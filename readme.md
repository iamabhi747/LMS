- Keep track of the number of copies of each book or magazine.
- Organize books and magazines by section, shelf, and serial number.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss your ideas or submit a pull request with your changes.

### TODOs

Here are some areas where you can contribute:

1. **Full Support for Magazines**: Currently, the support for magazines is partial. We need to add more features to fully support magazines in our library management system.

2. **UI Beautification**: The current UI of the app is functional but could use some improvements. If you have a knack for UI/UX, your contributions would be highly appreciated.

3. **Improve Search Function**: The search function works but it could be more efficient and smart. We need to implement a more robust search algorithm that can handle complex queries and return results faster.

Remember to follow the project's code style and write tests for any new features or changes.
